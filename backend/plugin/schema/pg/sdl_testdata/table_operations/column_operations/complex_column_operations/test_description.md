# Complex Column Operations Test

This test validates the SDL migration handling of complex scenarios combining multiple column operations:

## Test Coverage

- **Mixed Operations**: Adding, modifying, and dropping columns in same migration
- **Type Changes with Constraints**: Changing types while adding constraints
- **Dependency Management**: Handling indexes and foreign keys during column changes
- **Column Renaming**: Simulating column renames through drop/add operations
- **Data Preservation**: Ensuring operations preserve data integrity

## Validation Goals

- Verify proper operation ordering and dependency resolution
- Validate complex DDL generation with multiple ALTER statements
- Ensure constraint and index management during column changes
- Test migration safety and data integrity

## Expected Behavior

The migration should generate properly ordered DDL statements that handle dependencies correctly while preserving data integrity throughout the transformation.
