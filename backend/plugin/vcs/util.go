// DistinctFileItem is an item for distinct file in push event commits.
// We are observing the push webhook event so that we will receive the event either when:
// 1. A commit is directly pushed to a branch.
// 2. One or more commits are merged to a branch.
//
// There is a complication to deal with the 2nd type. A typical workflow is a developer first
// commits the migration file to the feature branch, and at a later point, she creates a merge
// request to merge the commit to the main branch. Even the developer only creates a single commit
// on the feature branch, that merge request may contain multiple commits (unless both squash and fast-forward merge are used):
// 1. The original commit on the feature branch.
// 2. The merge request commit.
//
// And both commits would include that added migration file. Since we create an issue per migration file,
// we need to filter the commit list to prevent creating a duplicated issue. GitLab has a limitation to distinguish
// whether the commit is a merge commit (https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/30914), so we need to dedup
// ourselves. Below is the filtering algorithm:
//  1. If we observe the same migration file multiple times, then we should use the latest migration file. This does not matter
//     for change-based migration since a developer would always create different migration file with incremental names, while it
//     will be important for the state-based migration, since the file name is always the same and we need to use the latest snapshot.
//  2. Maintain the relative commit order between different migration files. If migration file A happens before migration file B,
//     then we should create an issue for migration file A first.
