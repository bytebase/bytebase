# Commit Messages Guide

This guide describes how we add human and machine-readable commit messages.

Refer to [Conventional Commits 1.0.0](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/)

## Benefits

* Automatically generating CHANGELOGs and release notes.
* Communicating the nature of changes to teammates, the public, and other stakeholders.
* Making it easier for people to contribute to your projects, by allowing them to explore a more structured commit history.

## Summary

Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit message. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history, which improves better readability, velocity and automation.

## Commit Message Style

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Header

The header is a `mandatory` line that simply describes the purpose of the change.

```bash
<type>[optional scope]: <description>
```

It consists of three parts in itself:

* `Type` - a short prefix that represents the kind of the change
* `Scope` - optional information that represents the context of the change
* `Subject` - represents a concise description of actual change

> üí° Notice that there also has a colon and space(`:<space>`), which separated the type and description

### Body

The body is optional lines that introduce the motivation behind the change or just describing slightly more detailed information.

### Footer

The footer is optional lines that mention consequences which stems from the change - such as announcing a breaking change, linking closed issues, mentioning contributors and so on.

## Examples

### Commit message with no body

```bash
docs: correct spelling of CHANGELOG
```

### Commit message with scope

```bash
feat(lang): add polish language
```

### Commit message with description and breaking change footer

```bash
feat: allow provided config object to extend other configs

BREAKING CHANGE: `extends` key in config file is now used for extending other config files
```

### Commit message with body and footer

```bash
fix: prevent racing of requests

Introduce a request id and a reference to latest request. Dismiss
incoming responses other than from latest request.

Reviewed-by: Z
```

## Common Types
