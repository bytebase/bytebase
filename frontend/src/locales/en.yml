intro:
  content: Bytebase is for DBAs and Developers to collaborate on database schemas
        changes. One can construct a single pipeline to propagate the schema
        change across multiple environments. One can also store the schemas in
        VCS and trigger a new pipeline upon commit push. Follow the {quickstart} on the bottom left to get
        familiar with the product. If you encounter problems, visit {doc} or report {issue} on GitHub.

    tip: If your team use a separate SQL console such as phpMyAdmin, you can
        provide its URL pattern here. Once provided, Bytebase will surface the
        console link on the relevant database and table UI.
