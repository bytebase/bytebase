intro:
  content: >-
    Bytebase is for DBAs and Developers to collaborate on database schemas
    changes. One can construct a single pipeline to propagate the schema change
    across multiple environments. One can also store the schemas in VCS and
    trigger a new pipeline upon commit push. Follow the {quickstart} on the
    bottom left to get familiar with the product. If you encounter problems,
    visit {doc} or report {issue} on GitHub.

      If your team use a separate SQL console such as phpMyAdmin, you can
      provide its URL pattern here. Once provided, Bytebase will surface the
      console link on the relevant database and table UI.
