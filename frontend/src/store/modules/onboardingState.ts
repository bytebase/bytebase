 * OnboardingState will tell if we are onboarding the workspace, so we can do
 * some welcomes, tutorials, demonstrations if needed.
 *
 * example:
 * - { isOnboarding: false }
 *   (the default and fallback value) means we are not onboarding the workspace
 * - { isOnboarding: true, consumed: ["a", "b"] }
 *   means we are onboarding the workspace, and module "a" and "b" already
 *   consumed the onboarding state.
 *
 * If the value in localStorage is gone (e.g., the user cleared the browser
 * data), the onboarding state will also be cleared. This is to ensure that the
 * onboarding actions will never fire more than once.
