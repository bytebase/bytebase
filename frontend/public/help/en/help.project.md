title: What is 'project' ?
---

- The Bytebase project shares similarities with project concepts found in other popular development tools like GitLab and Jira.

- Each project has its own set of members, and every issue and database is always associated with a single project.

- A project can also be configured to associate with a code repository to enable GitOps workflows.
